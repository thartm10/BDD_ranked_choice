# BDD_ranked_choice
Script to match patients to their preferred doctor using ranked preference lists provided by the paitents.

# Approach
The algorithim randomized the patients in a list and tries to match each patient to the highest ranked doctor on their list. If the doctor's capacity is full and the already-matched patients have the doctor ranked equal or higher than the current patient, the algorithm moves on to the next doctor on the patient's list. If the current patient has ranked the doctor higher than one of the patients on the tenative list, the existing patient is removed from the list and added back into the unmatched queue. The algorithm repeats this until every patient has been matched. 

# Specifications
The ranking algorithm reads in a csv file generated by the BDDcsvMaker.py script which makes a randomized patient preference list given the number of patients and doctors provided. Since constant doctor capacity could be assumed, the doctor capacity was set to be the minimum capacity needed to be able to accomodate all of the patients.
